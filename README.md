# rotating_frame

Python script to test the qutip python library.

Two state dynamics in the rotating wave approximation.
I define the steady state solutions of the Bloch equations for
a magnetization M = [Mx, My, Mz]. 
I should be able to reproduce these curves using the steady state
solver of the qutip library.
